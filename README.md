# IOT-weather-monitoring

A comprehensive IoT-based project designed to measure, record, and analyze meteorological conditions, providing valuable insights for various applications such as agriculture, transportation, energy management, and weather forecasting.

---
## Introduction

The Smart Weather Monitoring System measures and records various meteorological parameters, including:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed and direction
- Precipitation
- Gas concentration

It provides real-time weather information, enabling accurate weather predictions and informed decision-making.

---

### Software
- **Arduino IDE**
- **ThingSpeak for cloud data storage**
- **Python (for data analysis using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **Tinkercad (for circuit simulation)**

---

## System Architecture
1. Sensors collect environmental data.
2. Arduino processes data and sends it to ThingSpeak via ESP8266.
3. Data is displayed locally on an LCD and stored for remote monitoring.
4. Machine learning models analyze data for predictive insights.
